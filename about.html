        <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Abhishek Kumar</strong>, a passionate software developer currently pursuing a B.E. in Computer Science at Chandigarh University. I specialize in backend development using <strong>Java, Spring Boot, SQL</strong>, and DevOps tools like <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>Jenkins</strong>.</p>

        <p>I'm deeply interested in building scalable web applications and solving real-world problems. I’ve developed multiple full-stack projects including a <strong>Recipe Sharing Platform</strong>, <strong>Food Waste Reduction System</strong>, and a <strong>Local Community Skill Exchange</strong> platform.</p>

        <p>I also have a good understanding of <strong>AWS services</strong> like EC2, S3, and IAM, and have deployed cloud-based applications using CI/CD pipelines through GitHub and Docker Hub.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I explore cloud and DevOps tools, contribute on GitHub, and help others as a tutor through Chegg. I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and grow as a developer.</p>
